In left side menu, use icons and add these:
	Home link : takes to app screen no.1
	About link: on click opens a page. It can be kept static but dynamic is better
	Contact Link: Simple page lists button style Contact numbers, address or can also add google map with location
	Faculty Link: Details of few people with emails and phone numbers; Use List> Exapandable> List big image style and add two button style email and phone number options on bottom of every list.
		On click, email button should send email (launch app/open browser). Phone button should take that number to phone keypad for making a call.
	3 other links, button style with just outbound urls (Will send urls soon, just use google.com for now)
	Settings : to manage app settings/ unsub from notifications etc.
